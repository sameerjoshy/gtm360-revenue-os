            problemRecognition: `
                <p>The situation is painfully common in B2B reviews:</p>
                <p>The team hits their activity targets. Marketing delivers the MQL commit. The CRM shows "3x coverage" for the quarter.</p>
                <p>Yet, by week 8 of the quarter, the forecast starts slipping. Deals that looked "committed" get pushed. The gap to plan widens, and the scramble begins.</p>
                <p>Leadership looks at the data and sees a math problem: <em>"If we closed 20% of $10M last time, we just need $15M in pipe to hit our growth number."</em></p>
            `,
            wrongExplanation: `
                <p>The default diagnosis is almost always volume.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"We need more at bats."</li>
                    <li>"Marketing needs to fill the top of the funnel."</li>
                    <li>"SDRs aren't making enough calls."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is a reasonable assumption. In simple systems, output is directly correlated to input. If you want more manufacturing output, you add more raw materials. Sales leaders, under pressure from boards who love "coverage metrics," double down on generation.</p>
            `,
            whyItFails: `
                <p>This explanation fails because B2B sales is not a manufacturing line; it is a filtration system.</p>
                <p>When you dump more volume into a system with unclear "exit criteria" (how a deal moves from one stage to the next), you don't get more revenue. You get more noise.</p>
                <p><strong>Volume breaks valid signals.</strong> When reps have 50 opps instead of 15, they cannot vigorously disqualify. They keep "maybe" deals alive to show activity.</p>
                <p><strong>Bad deals consume the resources meant for good deals.</strong> Every hour spent prepping a demo for a curious non-buyer is an hour stolen from a real champion.</p>
            `,
            actualConstraint: `
                <p>The constraint is not <strong>Entry Volume</strong>. It is <strong>Throughput Integrity</strong>.</p>
                <p>Specifically, the definitions of "Qualified" and "Stage Progression" are usually based on <em>seller activity</em> (we gave a demo) rather than <em>buyer verification</em> (they agreed to a pilot).</p>
                <p>If your Stage 2 -> Stage 3 conversion rate is low, adding 2x more leads to Stage 1 implies you will just waste 2x more SDR time—not close 2x more deals.</p>
            `,
            consequences: `
                <p>Ignoring this creates a "Death Spiral of Coverage":</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You demand more pipeline.</li>
                    <li>Marketing lowers the bar to hit the lead number.</li>
                    <li>Sales gets flooded with low-intent conversations.</li>
                    <li>Win rates drop because focus is diluted.</li>
                    <li>You miss the number.</li>
                    <li>You conclude you need <em>even more pipeline</em> to make up for the lower win rate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This burns cash, burns out reps, and confuses product teams who get feedback from people who were never going to buy.</p>
            `,
            whatChanges: `
                <p>To fix this, you must stop solving for coverage and start solving for transfer.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Redefine "Qualified":</strong> It is not "BANT." It is a verified exchange of value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Gating:</strong> Reps cannot move a deal to Stage 2 without an artifact from the buyer (e.g., a mutual success plan or access to power).</li>
                    <li><strong>Kill "Zombie" Deals:</strong> If a deal hasn't moved in 30 days, it is closed-lost. No exceptions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Buying more leads won't help until you fix the filter.</p>
